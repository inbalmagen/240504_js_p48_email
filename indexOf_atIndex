The line 
const atIndex = email.indexOf('@'); 
in JavaScript assigns the index of the "@" symbol within the email string to the variableatIndex.

Let's break down this line to understand it better:

 1.
 email.indexOf('@'):

The indexOf() method in JavaScript is used to find the index of a specified value (in this case, 
the "@" symbol) within a string.

It searches the email string for the first occurrence of "@" and returns the index of its first occurrence.
 If the "@" symbol is not found, it returns -1.

For example, if email is "user@example.com", email.indexOf('@') will return 4, 
as "@" is located at the index 4 in the string.

2.
const atIndex = ...:

This line declares a constant variable named atIndex.

const is used to declare a constant variable, meaning its value cannot be reassigned 
once it has been initialized.

By assigning the result of email.indexOf('@') to atIndex, we store the index of the "@" symbol 
in the email string in the variable atIndex.

Example:
Let's consider an example where email is "user@example.com":

const email = "user@example.com";
const atIndex = email.indexOf('@');
console.log(atIndex); // Output: 4

In this example, atIndex will be assigned the value 4, 
as the "@" symbol is located at the index 4 within the email string. 
This value can then be used in further processing or validation logic related to the email address.
