- 1: Subtracts 1 from the length to account for JavaScript indexing, where indexing starts from 0.


In the expression email.split('@').length - 1, the - 1 is used to calculate the number of occurrences
 of the "@" symbol in the email string. Let's break it down to understand why this operation is necessary:

Splitting the String: email.split('@') takes the email string and splits it into an array of substrings
 at each occurrence of the "@" character. For instance, if email is "user@example.com", 
 the result of email.split('@') would be ["user", "example.com"].

Calculating the Length: .length on the resulting array gives the number of elements in that array.
 Continuing with the previous example, ["user", "example.com"].length would yield 2.

Understanding - 1: The number of elements in the array resulting from the split is always one more than the
 number of "@" characters in the original string. 
 This is because splitting divides the string into parts that were separated by the "@" symbol:
If there is one "@" in the string, the split results in two parts (before and after the "@").
If there are two "@" symbols, the split results in three parts, and so on.

Hence, to find out how many "@" characters are in the email, you subtract 1 from the array length. 
If the original string contains exactly one "@", splitting it will result in an array of two elements 
(length - 1 = 1).

Logical Check: By checking if (email.split('@').length - 1 !== 1), the code is essentially confirming
 whether there is exactly one "@" symbol in the email string. 
 This is crucial for validating email addresses since a valid email should have exactly one "@" symbol:
If the result of this check is true (i.e., the condition is met),
 it means there is not exactly one "@", which is either zero or more than one "@" in the email address,
  indicating it is invalid.
This approach helps ensure that the format of the email address meets the basic criteria necessary for most
 email validation scenarios, focusing on the structure regarding the "@" symbol's occurrence.
