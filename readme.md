# Email Validation Program

## Overview
This Email Validation Program is designed to help users check the validity of email addresses based on standard formatting rules. It ensures that an email address contains exactly one "@" sign, no spaces, a dot after the "@" sign, and ends with a recognized domain such as `.com`, `.org`, or `.net`.

## Features
- **Single @ Check**: Ensures the email contains exactly one "@" symbol.
- **Position Check**: Validates that the "@" is not the first or last character.
- **Dot Presence**: Checks for at least one dot in the domain part of the email, following the "@" symbol.
- **Space Check**: Confirms that there are no spaces before or after the "@".
- **Domain Validation**: Ensures the email ends with a valid domain.
